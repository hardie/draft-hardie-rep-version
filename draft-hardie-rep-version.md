--- abstract

The Robots Exclusion Protocol is a set of rules which a site owner may request that automated clients use when crawling the resources available via the web or other access methods{{RFC9309}}).  Historical practice has been that extensions to the base specification which are not parsable by a client are ignored. As the community considers specifying a new set of behaviors for crawlers which gather data for large language models or similar systems, this permissive approach may need to be reconsidered.
